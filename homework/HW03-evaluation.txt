Your score: 0 out of 50 = 100% which is not your best work, I'm sure...

Comments/feedback:

Kelly, I'm sorry you didn't turn this in.  I know it isn't the biggest impact
on your overall score for the course, but every little bit helps toward the
goal.

I hope to see you at the project presentations on Wednesday, although I don't
see a copy of your poster in your repository.  I hope you have made one and
sent it to Masao by now for printing......

It has been a great pleasure to have you in my class, and I look forward to
hearing from you as you make your marks upon the world and the industry.
Keep up the good work!
