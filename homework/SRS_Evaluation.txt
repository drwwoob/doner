Software Requirements Specification Document:
---------------------------------------------
-- Introduction Section
   Nice introduction to the document.  Check your spelling and grammar.  You
   have an inconsistency in section 1.2 where you call your program 'Diner'.
   Good that it's short, but a diagram might help in understanding exactly
   what you are planning.  Either a diagram of the parts of your system,
   or a mock-up of what the user interface will look like would be helpful,
   but is not required.

-- Functional Requirements
   Wow, Kelly!  This is really really good!  You have enough requirements to
   cover all the parts and the operations of your application, you have the
   language down, and your use of 'will' statements to augment the 'shall'
   statements is great!  I found a couple of places where you have multiple
   'shall' statements under the same number.  Remember that EVERY 'shall'
   needs its own number ~ it's the 'will' statements that are paired with
   the 'shall' statements that aren't numbered.

-- Performance Requirements
   Same comment here as for functional requirements.

-- Environment Requirements
   This is perfect, no further comments from me, and nothing for you to do to
   this section.

=============================================================================
your score:  9.5% out of 10% which is an A

All in all, a GREAT first effort, you just need to revisit the numbering of
your 'shall' statements.

Make the changes as suggested above for the second submission and you'll get
the full 10% on this document.
