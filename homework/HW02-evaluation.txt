Comments:
---------
Nice work on this assignment.

On 5.6 that's an interesting approach, having a document database rather
than a relational one, or even a monolithic application.  You make a good
case for this situation and you are the only person in the class to suggest
that solution!  Cool!

On 5.8 you have an interesting way of doing the signs and digits all in the
same state, then following that with a digit entry action.  Very nice!

There are quite a few spelling and/or grammar errors here.  Take your time
to double check to make sure that doesn't happen in your writing!  You do
such nice work, it's a shame to have it marred by this kind of error...

....just sayin'....

Good job overall, Kelly!  You are doing well, so keep it up!
