CMSI 4072 project ~ Spring 2024
Kelly Tao
Doner game project
==============================

Proposal Document:
------------------
   This is a very imaginative project ~ I like your thinking about giving a
   user story-telling capability that they can use to develop a narrative
   without having to do programming!



Proposal Presentation:
----------------------
   Good job on the presentation!  The slides look great, I really like the
   idea of this project, and the background pictures are most interesting!
   Your presentation was engaging and fun, and you talked to the audience
   instead of just reading the slides.  I like that you presented it as if
   it is a conversation between the two characters on the screen ~ VERY
   imaginative!

   I think you could put in a little more next time about what it will look
   like, what the user interface might be, so that we can see a bit more
   about your plan.

   All in all, very good work, Kelly.
